# Observer
Observer is a privacy-enhancing browser add-on (or extension) that identifies and blocks third-party trackers as you browse the web. Observer also provides real-time statistics and 24-hour summaries of your browsing behaviour -- personally informing you of a subset of your entire digital footprint.

> This project is part of my undergraduate Final Year Project.

# Compatibility
* Chromium-based web browsers (Chrome, Brave, etc.)

# Submission
* This GitHub repository hosts all the source code for the project. Alongside this repository, I have also submitted a report.

# Installation for testing
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the extensions page on your web browser. Alternatively, type ```chrome://extensions/``` in your URL bar.
3. Ensure "Developer Mode" is turned on.
4. Click the "Load Unpacked" button.
5. Navigate and select the root folder of Observer, or open the folder itself and select any file in the root directory.
6. Et Voila! Observer will now be installed on your web-browser. Its icon can now be selected from the top-right of the browser, if it is pinned.
